## Projects

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

- [EDA on COVID-19 Dataset:](https://github.com/KhaledMoheyD/EDA-on-Covid19-Dataset) This is a data analysis practice project by "Data Science Lovers". In this project I applied some analysis technique on covid-19 dataset. I explored the data and applied some analysis functions.
- [EDA on Police Dataset:](https://github.com/KhaledMoheyD/EDA-on-Police-Dataset) This is a data analysis practice project by "Data Science Lovers". In this project I applied some analysis technique on a Police dataset. I explored the data, cleaned the data, and handled some categorical features
- [EDA on Cars Dataset:](https://github.com/KhaledMoheyD/EDA-on-Cars-Dataset) This is a data analysis practice project by "Data Science Lovers". In this project I applied some analysis technique on a Cars dataset. I explored the data, cleaned the data, and applied some filters.
- [EDA on Weather Dataset:](https://github.com/KhaledMoheyD/EDA-on-Weather-Dataset) This is a data analysis practice project by "Data Science Lovers". In this project I applied some analysis technique on a weather dataset. Also, I explored the data.

### Data Analysis:

- [Ecommerce Sales Dashboard using Power BI:](https://github.com/KhaledMoheyD/E-commerce-Sales-Dashboard-PowerBI) This project is a data analysis of an e-commerce website aimed at providing insights into the business's performance and identifying areas for improvement and growth.

### Machine Learning:

-  [Customer Lifetime Value Prediction - EDA & ML](https://github.com/KhaledMoheyD/Customer-Lifetime-Value-Prediction) In this Machine learning project, we are predicting the lifetime value of customers for a business based on their historical interactions using Regression Techniques

-  [Spaceship Titanic - EDA & ML:](https://github.com/KhaledMoheyD/Spaceship-Titanic-EDA-ML) This is a Kaggle competition in which we are predicting which passengers were transported by the anomaly using records recovered from the spaceshipâ€™s damaged computer system.
we are exploring the data, cleaning the data, and preprocessing the data.
also we applied some visualization methods to better understand the data
we used Random Forest Classifier in this project

### Time Series Analysis:
- [Time Series Analysis on Imstagram Reach:](https://github.com/KhaledMoheyD/Time-Series-Analysis-on-Instagram-Reach) This is a practice project on Time Series analysis applied on the reach of an Instagram account using SARIMA model.
