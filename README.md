## Projects

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

- [EDA on COVID-19 Dataset](https://github.com/KhaledMoheyD/EDA-on-Covid19-Dataset) This is a data analysis practice project by "Data Science Lovers". In this project I applied some analysis technique on covid-19 dataset. I explored the data and applied some analysis functions.
- [EDA on Police Dataset](https://github.com/KhaledMoheyD/EDA-on-Police-Dataset) This is a data analysis practice project by "Data Science Lovers". In this project I applied some analysis technique on a Police dataset. I explored the data, cleaned the data, and handled some categorical features
- [EDA on Cars Dataset](https://github.com/KhaledMoheyD/EDA-on-Cars-Dataset) This is a data analysis practice project by "Data Science Lovers". In this project I applied some analysis technique on a Cars dataset. I explored the data, cleaned the data, and applied some filters.
- [EDA on Weather Dataset](https://github.com/KhaledMoheyD/EDA-on-Weather-Dataset) This is a data analysis practice project by "Data Science Lovers". In this project I applied some analysis technique on a weather dataset. Also, I explored the data.
